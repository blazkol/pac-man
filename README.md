# pac-man
A Pac-Man clone created in C ++ using SFML library

# Overwiew
This is one of my first projects. The purpose of its creation was to learn object-oriented programming in C++ and the use of external libraries. I used the SFML library because it is easy to learn and it is great for the purpose of creating a simple two-dimensional game.

# Technologies
- SFML 2.5.1
